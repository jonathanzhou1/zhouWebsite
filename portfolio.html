		<p><strong>Fish are Friends, not Food</strong><br>
			There are a variety of different sizes, colors, and shapes used in the program to make an ocean scenery consisting of sand, water, a crab, a jellyfish, kelp, a rock, an octopus, sunken treasure, and a starfish. To enhance the program, there is movement in the form of floating bubbles and swimming fish. The fish shape changes when moving in different directions or when in contact with the shark. In the process of coding the program, our group used numerous nested loops, conditional statements, and relational statements.

			Click on bugs to stamp a troll face and receive a math question. If you answer the math question correctly, you will receive a point. If you answer the question wrong, then you don't get a point, but you can still keep on playing. There is a timer that counts down from 30 seconds. Once the timer is done, the game is finished and displays the number of correct questions out of total questions. After each fly is clicked, the new fly will go to a new location based on a randomly chosen index.
