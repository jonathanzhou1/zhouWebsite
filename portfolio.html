			There are a variety of different sizes, colors, and shapes used in the program to make an ocean scenery consisting of sand, water, a crab, a jellyfish, kelp, a rock, an octopus, sunken treasure, and a starfish. To enhance the program, there is movement in the form of floating bubbles and swimming fish. The fish shape changes when moving in different directions or when in contact with the shark. In the process of coding the program, our group used numerous nested loops, conditional statements, and relational statements.
